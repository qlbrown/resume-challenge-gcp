# Cloud Resume Challenge GCP Edition
This is my journey in completing the Cloud Resume Challenge for GCP. I performed the following actions to complete the challenge:

1. Wrote resume in HTML ( I used a template for this)
2. Styled in CSS (made changes to the template I used to style)
3. Deployed as Static Website on GCP Storage Bucket
4. Used HTTPS security for URL & Cloud CDN to cache site
5. Pointed a custom DNS domain name to the load balancer endpoint
6. Wrote Javascript code to build a visitor counter that displays how many people have accessed the site
7. Created a Cloud Firestore Database to retrieve and store the visitor count
8. Built an API that accepts requests from the web app and communicates with the database through a Cloud Function that has an HTTP trigger
9. Developed Infrastructure as Code through Deployment Manager to automate the configuration of the infrastructure
10. Wrote a blog post to describe the journey of completing this cloud project.
