Cloud Resume Challenge GCP Edition
This is my journey in completing the Cloud Resume Challenge for GCP. I performed the following actions to complete the challenge:

Wrote resume in HTML ( I used a template for this)
Styled in CSS (made changes to the template I used to style)
Deployed as Static Website on GCP Storage Bucket
Used HTTPS security for URL & Cloud CDN to cache site
Pointed a custom DNS domain name to the load balancer endpoint
Wrote Javascript code to build a visitor counter that displays how many people have accessed the site
Created a Cloud Firestore Database to retrieve and store the visitor count
Built an API that accepts requests from the web app and communicates with the database through a Cloud Function that has an HTTP trigger
Developed Infrastructure as Code through Deployment Manager to automate the configuration of the infrastructure
Wrote a blog post to describe the journey of completing this cloud project.
